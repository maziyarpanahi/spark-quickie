# Chapter 7: Advanced Data Operations

As you become more comfortable with basic DataFrame operations, Spark offers advanced functionalities for more sophisticated data processing needs, such as window functions for analytics over partitions of data and strategies for managing large datasets efficiently.

## Window Functions

Window functions perform calculations across rows related to the current row, within a specified "window" of the dataset. These are useful for running totals, moving averages, and other cumulative or comparative analytics.

### Scala Example

```scala
import org.apache.spark.sql.expressions.Window
import org.apache.spark.sql.functions._

val windowSpec = Window.partitionBy("department").orderBy("salary")

val df = spark.createDataFrame(Seq(
  ("Marketing", "John Doe", 3000),
  ("Marketing", "Jane Doe", 4000),
  ("Sales", "Mike Jones", 4000),
  ("Sales", "Judy Smith", 3000),
  ("IT", "James Brown", 3500)
)).toDF("department", "name", "salary")

val rankedDf = df.withColumn("rank", rank().over(windowSpec))
rankedDf.show()
```

### Python (PySpark) Example

```python
from pyspark.sql.window import Window
from pyspark.sql import functions as F

windowSpec = Window.partitionBy("department").orderBy("salary")

df = spark.createDataFrame([
  ("Marketing", "John Doe", 3000),
  ("Marketing", "Jane Doe", 4000),
  ("Sales", "Mike Jones", 4000),
  ("Sales", "Judy Smith", 3000),
  ("IT", "James Brown", 3500)
], ["department", "name", "salary"])

rankedDf = df.withColumn("rank", F.rank().over(windowSpec))
rankedDf.show()
```

## Handling Large Datasets with Partitioning

When working with large datasets, managing and optimizing data partitioning is crucial for performance. Spark allows you to partition your data across the cluster to optimize query execution.

### Repartitioning DataFrames

#### Scala Example

```scala
// Repartitioning a DataFrame to increase the number of partitions
val repartitionedDf = df.repartition(200)
println(repartitionedDf.rdd.partitions.size)
```

#### Python (PySpark) Example

```python
# Repartitioning a DataFrame to increase the number of partitions
repartitionedDf = df.repartition(200)
print(repartitionedDf.rdd.getNumPartitions())
```

### Coalescing DataFrames

Reducing the number of partitions without shuffling the data can be achieved using `coalesce`.

#### Scala Example

```scala
// Reducing the number of partitions using coalesce
val coalescedDf = df.coalesce(1)
println(coalescedDf.rdd.partitions.size)
```

#### Python (PySpark) Example

```python
# Reducing the number of partitions using coalesce
coalescedDf = df.coalesce(1)
print(coalescedDf.rdd.getNumPartitions())
```

Partitioning strategies can significantly impact the performance of your Spark applications, especially when dealing with large volumes of data. By adjusting the number of partitions, you can optimize resource utilization and improve query execution times.
